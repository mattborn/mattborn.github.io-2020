Case Study

# How I helped my team find non-obvious answers to address high stakes usability problems

<p class="Lede">Getting past what our clients were requesting to understand <strong><em>what they really needed</em></strong> took a couple months and resulted in an elegant, feedback-driven solution that saves countless hours on both sides.<p>

## Some backstory

All of the standard reports in [Artemis](https://www.artemishealth.com/solutions/for-employers) can be filtered. This is great because clients often want to look at numbers for a specific group of people like diabetics. If a client wanted to answer _“how much did we spend on diabetics last year?”_ they simply add a filter to match only diabetics. Easy.

One big problem with the standard reports is they were hard-coded when originally built which means clients could not change the measures. Since standard reports used only a small percentage of all the measures available, it was a common request. In fact, this request came up in my first four feedback sessions with clients. The accepted workaround was to have an internal analyst build a custom story upon request. As our business grew, this became a burden and accounted for as much as 90% of our internal analysts’ work. Not good.

## Taking the time to understand

As we observed and interviewed internal users to understand why this was so time-consuming, we learned the problem was much deeper. Not only did each analyst have to attempt to rebuild the standard reports from scratch and explain unavoidable deviations, clients often had a very specific way they needed to match diabetics. The best (and sometimes only) way to accomplish this was to create a cohort—this was a one-time snapshot of people matching the filter criteria. Once this happened, analysts or account managers would have to manually update these snapshots each time the client received new data. Every month.

We recognized we needed a big change: to offer “people filters” that were usable in standard and custom reports which let clients configure exactly how they wanted the filter to work while automatically fetching any new matches each month.

We called these **Dynamic Cohorts.™**

## Pre-validation with iterative design

Over the course of 7 weeks, I designed over 150 screens in Sketch and created several click-through prototypes in InVision. Each week, we tested with internal and external users including key stakeholders from our top consultant partner and our largest customer **representing hundreds of thousands of Amercian lives in our system.**

I cannot share everything associated with this project, but here are a few screens from the production reference deck:

I am happy to answer any questions about this project upon request.
