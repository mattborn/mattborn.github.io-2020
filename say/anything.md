# Say anything

Not just one of my [favorite films](https://youtu.be/jKsQq2Lu8R4?t=68) and [bands during my formative years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZGRzdywXqs), but a life lesson and principle I’d like to practice more.

Recently, I reacted poorly to a situation with one of my daughters simply copying a craft my other daughter had just made. And in an attempt to outdo her, simply made two copies. This bothered me, and I told her she should just do her own thing. What I didn’t say then —perhaps because I felt hypocritical hence this writing—is that anything she does is worth doing. Worth exploring. Worth understanding through the lens of having externalized whatever it is.

Just do anything.

And with that I realized that perhaps copying is just as fair as attempting something original. As long as it moves you forward. And more importantly, that you appreciate yourself, your ability, and whatever you manage to come up with. Especially if you don’t come up with much.

So with that, I leave this as a reminder to just say anything.
