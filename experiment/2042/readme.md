# Ideas

For future projects. Can’t keep up.

## Enterprise Access UX

Goal: Address all of the common pitfalls I’ve seen.

* Enterprise-grade (whatever that means)
* Signin, password, account, and profile components
* Basic event tracking
* Persistance across multiple environments (same domain)
* Temporary, shared access codes
* Single Sign On (truly) / Firebase starter

## Streaming Service UI

Goal: Build the modern card catalogue experience.

* TV remote-first (the new mobile-first)
* Cards
* Immersive previews
* Sections

## And How

Goal: Publish my comprehensive product design methodology.

* Based on [The 5 Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)
* Learn together weekly (how who when)
* Constrain when and it’s no longer the hardest question to answer
* What = A blend of old & new sciences
* Company = cooperative (group project / team productivity / [not GTD](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done))
* What = The right tool for the job
* What = Design fundamentals
* What = Timeless elements
* Who’s who of my career
* Why? [Common good.](https://medium.com/ideo-stories/the-next-big-thing-in-design-513522543a6f)
* What = Video?
* What = Immersion?
* What = Survey?
* What = Mature team & org product increments a la Basecamp
* What = Tom Chi vs. Marty Cagan vs. Jason Fried vs. Agile Manifesto vs. Lean
* What = Alternate 4x4 quarterly roadmap (already built) & heatmap (top requests, ea. w/ real world problem & hypothesis)

## ~Billboard UI~

Goal: The most elemental display component. People don’t read.

[It’s here.](/experiment/2037)

## Input UI

Goal: The most elemental data component.

## Minterface

Goal: A collection of thoughtful, reusable styles.

## Aloop

Goal: Automate daily decisions. Self-care. Minimalism.

* Mindfulness
* Hygeine
* Food
* Clothing
* Work
* Entertainment
* List (loop) + logic + link (accountability)

## Ephemeral Work Groups UX

Goal: Domain-specific, real-time collaboration.

## Recruit + Book UX

Goal: Simple experience for learning from the right people.

* Google has a couple rules that seem to work well for small companies trying to create sustainable value through innovation.
* [Focus on the user and all else will follow.](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html)
* Compel others to join the work you are doing—convince team, then customer, then company, then book-of-business, then market. See: “grouplet”
* Everyone is a volunteer. It’s easier than ever for you to work anywhere. This limits management’s coercive capability. Thus, we have internal mobility. As leaders, we must persuade our colleagues of our vision.
* Culture eats strategy for breakfast. Peter Drucker?

## Router

* Fun names: routelet, routehouse, droute (drought), trouter, routeric, routedone, routefit, routeset, routeput, routerun, routeback, routecast
