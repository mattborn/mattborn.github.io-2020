# Experiment # 2045 — Deep Router

Addressable state encapsulation. 

## Goal

I struggled to extend last week’s experiment to handle nested routes, so I shall figure it out now.

## Concepts

### Arbitrary vs. nested render targets

### Swap vs. expand vs. focus

### Data vs. template vs. function
