# Q&A with Matt

First published on September 26th, 2020

## Who are you?

My name is Matt Born. I am a designer from Chicago. My family of five currently resides in Salt Lake City where we helped start [Ridgeline Church](https://ridgeline.church). We like to travel, hike, dance, and be silly together as often as possible.

I’m currently taking a break with my family and am leaving myself open to design leadership roles.

## What do you want to do?

I can help teams rapidly test their ideas. Every team I’ve worked with tends to struggle to balance human input with thoughtful system design while sustaining the business. I am experienced in showing others how to quickly produce embodied experiences informed by the needs of users. I want to help companies understand the value of a structured and collaborative approach to design.

## What have you done to prepare you to do that?

Throughout my career, I have helped countless companies test their ideas across digital and traditional mediums. Since 2012, I have focused on enterprise-grade, web-based software while solving for accessibility, automation, content management, people management, task management, social engagement, and big data analytics. I have created thousands of design assets, coded hundreds of prototypes, and led a dozen teams by managing backlogs, facilitating workshops, and communicating expectations. Most recently, I was the lead designer for [Artemis Health](https://artemishealth.com) a Series C health analytics platform based in Salt Lake.

## What have you accomplished?

1. In 2009, I earned a BFA in Graphic Design.
2. In 2012, I was part of the founding design team for [Chicago’s most darling, best-funded SaaS company](https://investors.sproutsocial.com) that went public in 2019.
3. I helped hire 15 product designers.
4. I helped start a [design system and a dedicated design system team](https://seeds.sproutsocial.com).
5. I mentored 18 students with a 100% job placement rate.
6. I have been married for 8 years, and we are learning how to raise 3 amazing little girls.
7. In the past 2 years, our non-profit has created 1,200+ deliverables for 30+ churches.

Having an exciting and successful career is such a blessing because it has supported our greatest accomplishment—a healthy family and lifestyle.
