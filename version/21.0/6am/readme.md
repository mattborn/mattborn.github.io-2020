# 6am

<p class="Lede">The daily, three-minute, Bible-based, morning Zoom community.</p>

Inspired by [Robin Sharma’s 5 AM Club](https://robinsharma.com/5am/) and Jesus:

> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, **he got up, went out,** and made his way to a deserted place; and there he was praying. Simon and his companions searched for him, and when they found him they said, “Everyone is looking for you.” [Mark 1:35–37 CSB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:35-37&version=CSB)

## Host guide

We rotate hosts weekly.

Keep it short and simple. Greet, share, and close.

As host, take a minute to share a Bible verse, say something encouraging, tell a story about what’s working or not working, or try an interactive prompt and solicit rapid responses.

There is no right or wrong way to do this. It’s OK to show up unprepared. The community matters more than the content.
