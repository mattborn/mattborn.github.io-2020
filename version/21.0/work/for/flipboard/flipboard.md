# Quick Case Studies

Hey, team! This is Matt Born. Here are a few condensed case studies about my work. Happy to dig deeper next time we chat.

## Artemis Health

This project was all about translating the complexity of database queries into an easy-to-use interface. I led all the design and research for this project.

## Toretto Car Event App Redesign

This was a fun project I completed recently and this case study highlights our end-to-end process in Figma for researching, organizing, validating, and handing off design work.
