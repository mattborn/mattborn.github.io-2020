# Visual bookmarking

Tuesday, Jan 3, 2022

An obsession of mine. I’ve been doing this for years. I think it’s similar but distinct from blogging, but perhaps just as elemental.

Foundational to why the web and our devices are worth using.

Fundamental as an extension of ourselves.

Functional as the means we express that extension.

## And what is it exactly

Capturing the essence of something you found that carries value, and moving that distillation into a curated space.

It’s also known as digital scrapbooking, but I avoid that term in case it reinforces archaic paradigms.

Pinterest based their business model on this behavior, but did it in a way that relied too heavily on hosted images which is why I don’t use it.

## More services that focus on this

Years ago, I thought Evernote was going to satisify the need for a stronger visual bookmarking and contextual curation tool. After months of trial, it failed to impress me.

Eventually, I landed on [Hackpad which was acquired by Dropbox and turned into Paper](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/dropbox-is-closing-down-hackpad/) which I still use daily. You can think of Paper is to Dropbox what Google Docs is to Google Drive.

The main reason I use Paper is simply because it offers a more delightful experience than Google Docs while solving for most of the same behaviors.

So what’s the latest scoop these days?

[Dropmark](https://www.dropmark.com) and [Niice](https://niice.co) are still around, but it looks like [Niice pivoted](https://niice.co/blog/posts/nine) and I haven’t used Dropmark [since their redesign](https://www.dropmark.com/blog/new-look-same-great-dropmark/).

[InVision](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205249269-Intro-to-Boards), [Moodboard](http://gomoodboard.com) and [Bookmark OS](https://bookmarkos.com) still underwhelm.

There are still native desktop apps like [Inboard](https://inboardapp.com), but these are just not practical in a web-centered world. This is why [Ember](https://www.designernews.co/stories/58592-rip-ember) and Pixa both failed.

Reader apps like [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com), [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com), and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) are too narrow to be useful.

> _Sidebar, I almost worked for Flipboard last spring. Dodged a bullet with that since [they laid off everyone](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/17/flipboard-layoffs-21-percent-staff) I interviewed with._

## Where I landed today

I’m going to invoke Derek Sivers’ [hell yeah! philosophy](https://sive.rs/hellyeah) and run with Dropbox since that’s the only one on this list that inspired me.
