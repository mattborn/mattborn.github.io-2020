# Questions

On this page you’ll find a few examples of question frameworks you can use to help people solve problems.

> “Then do not stop to think about the reasons for what you are doing, about why you are questioning. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity. Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will give more than he receives.”

— Albert Einstein, [LIFE Magazine (1955)](https://books.google.com/books?id=dlYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64)
